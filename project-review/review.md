# Review 
We have discussed as a team and outlined a few ways in which we could have improved this assignment were we to do it again. 

1. __Organised a video call__: In the development of this project we communicated through text conversations. There was no major communication malfunctions but sometimes messsages can be lost or hareder to understand over text. Meaning some team members could be left with gaps in understanding, which slows down development and less efficiency.

2. __Developed  a format for development__: We could have created a template document that members of the team could fill in with thier part of the assignment. This could have lead to increased efficency and a document with a consistent design. 

3. __Time Managment__: Asked questions and clarafied issues earlier on in the development process.
